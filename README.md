# mlprojects
Free code camp certification project work.

This project uses the Book-Crossings dataset. 
This dataset contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.

After importing and cleaning the data, use NearestNeighbors from sklearn.neighbors to develop a model
that shows books that are similar to a given book. The Nearest Neighbors algorithm measures distance
to determine the “closeness” of instances.
